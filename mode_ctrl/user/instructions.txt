the user logs in to the system by its ID and Password
	-> the User's ID must be the same as the Student's ID
	-> the password field is included in its struct

after it log in correctly, he can:
	-> View his record (all his information is viewed in an organized structure) 
	-> Edit his name
	-> Edit his Password
	

So you must have functions to do this:
	-> View the record of the user
		- ⁯NOTE: he's just logged in, so his ID is saved, you must NOT ask him to enter it again
	-> Edit his name
	-> Edit his password
