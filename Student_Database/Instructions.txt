the student record must include the following:
	-> full name
	-> id
	-> age
	-> gender
	-> grades

	note: the student Password is Included in the User Module for the login purposes, but here we need only to collect the students information that 
	        would be used (viewed or removed or edited) by the user or the admin.
	
	note: if a student record is added you must add its login info to the User module too, so its ID and a new unique password are added to the 
	        User's Database.

	note: if a student record is removed, also its related information in the User module is also deleted, which means this student ID and Password
	        are going to be removed from the User Database
